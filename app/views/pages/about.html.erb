    <p>Hi, I'm Nick.  Help me turn my passion into my profession.</p>
    <p>
      I'm a 26 year old St. Louis native currently living in Columbia, Missouri.  A few years
      ago, I accepted a full-time position as a systems administrator with the University of Missouri.  I was 
      still an undergrad, but I saw it as an opportunity to gain professional experience that would set me 
      apart from other college graduates.  
    </p> 
    <p>
      My interests, however, have always been in web development.  After I graduated, I began to look
      for developer positions, but a few weeks into searching, I discovered Ruby on Rails.  I was hooked 
      almost immediately, so I decided to postpone the job search and take the time to build up my knowledge
      of Rails.   
    </p>
    <p>
      What attracted me to Rails wasn't just the code.  It was everything around the code, like how passionate
      and involved the developer community is.  There seems to be an abundance of innovation, where everything I 
      learn leads me to discover five more new and interesting things to learn.  While this would probably be a 
      rather unappealing concept for many developers, to me it's the very reason I want a career in web development.

      Thank you for taking the time to read this.  My hope is that you'll check out the rest of the site and want
      to contact me right away, but if not, consider these notes written by my manager on a recent evaluation:
    </p>    
    <ul id="quotes">
      <li class="odd">
        "Nick is beyond dependable.  He is always willing to go above and beyond to fix a problem or make something right."
      </li>
      <li class="even">
        "Nick is constantly working on new projects and other ways to take on increased responsibility."
      </li>
      <li class="odd">
        "Nick takes it upon himself to learn a new skill if it is appropriate.  He can pick things up very quickly and use
        them to improve the computing sites on campus."
      </li>
      <li class="even">
        "Nick can be creative in finding solutions to odd problems.  He doesn't dwell too long on why something is broken.  
        Rather, he saves that for after he has decided on, tested, and deployed a solution."
      </li>
      <li class="odd">
        "Nick is a perfectionist.  He hammers out the smallest details and works to resolve any problem that may arise.  It
        is obvious that he truly cares about how his work reflects back on him."
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Opinions like these are what led to my inclusion when 
      <a href="http://www.columbiatribune.com/news/2011/jan/05/dozens-of-um-it-employees-are-promoted" target="_blank">this happened</a>.  
      If all of this is an indication of my work ethic and the dedication I have to a job I don't even like, just imagine 
      what I can do for you.
